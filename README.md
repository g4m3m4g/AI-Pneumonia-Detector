# AI-Powered Pneumonia Detection

This project utilizes deep learning to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model has been trained on a dataset of X-ray images and is capable of distinguishing between **normal** and **pneumonia** cases. This project demonstrates how AI can aid in medical diagnostics, especially in regions with limited access to healthcare professionals.

## About the Project

This repository contains:
- A trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model that detects pneumonia from chest X-rays.
- A **Streamlit web app** that allows users to upload chest X-ray images for real-time predictions.
- A **TensorFlow Keras model** for the detection of pneumonia.

### Key Features:
- Upload a chest X-ray image for diagnosis.
- Predict the presence of pneumonia in the image.
- Display results with user-friendly outputs.

## Installation

### Clone the repository:
```bash
